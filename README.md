## kit-assignment-tests

Test collection for KIT programming assignments (WS16/17).
Feel free to improve, update, extend or add tests.

#### DISCLAIMER: Validity of tests not guaranteed!

### Prerequisites for "Final1" tests

Follow instructions [here](http://joshuagleitze.de/tutorien/programmieren1617/material/terminaltest) to setup JUnit and Hamcrest within your project and make sure to replace `Terminal.java` with the modified version as well.

---
### As of assignment 4, tests are based on JUnit and therefore require JUnit being added to your build path.

---
### Important notice for assignment "3-Tessellation"

Task A1 requires you to add a package declaration to your classes.
In case you don't use the `edu.kit.informatik.tessellation` package for your own classes, make sure to adjust the first line of the TessellationTest.java file!
